<p>Transmission genetics is exemplified by Mendel’s rules, which describe how genetic information is transmitted from parents to offspring. Consider a monohybrid cross:</p>

<p>Population genetics describes how genetic information is transmitted from a <span><em>population</em></span> of parents to a population of offspring. Consider, for example, the following data from the <span> <em>Est</em></span>-3 locus of <span><em>Zoarces viviparus</em></span>:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>This table describes, empirically, the relationship between the genotypes of mothers and the genotypes of their offspring.

<p>Using that notation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{cc}
p_f = \frac{2F_{11}+F_{12}}{2F_{11}+2F_{12}+2F_{22}} &amp;
q_f = \frac{2F_{22}+F_{12}}{2F_{11}+2F_{12}+2F_{22}} \\
 &amp; \\
p_m = \frac{2M_{11}+M_{12}}{2M_{11}+2M_{12}+2M_{22}} &amp;
q_m = \frac{2M_{22}+M_{12}}{2M_{11}+2M_{12}+2M_{22}} \quad ,
\end{array}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p_f\)</span> is the frequency of <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> in mothers and <span class="math inline">\(p_m\)</span> is the frequency of <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> in fathers.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Since every individual in the population must have one father and one mother, the frequency of <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> among offspring is the same in both sexes, namely <span class="math display">\[p = \frac{1}{2}(p_f + p_m) \quad ,\]</span> assuming that all matings have the same average fecundity and that the locus we’re studying is autosomal.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><span><strong>Question</strong></span>: Why do those assumptions matter?</p>
<p><span><strong>Answer</strong></span>: If <span class="math inline">\(p_f = p_m\)</span>, then the allele frequency among offspring is equal to the allele frequency in their parents, i.e., the allele frequency doesn’t change from one generation to the next. This might be considered the First Law of Population Genetics: <span><em>If no forces act to change allele frequencies between zygote formation and breeding, allele frequencies will not change.</em></span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="zero-force-laws">Zero force laws</h2>
<p>This is an example of what philosophers call a <span><strong>zero force law</strong></span>. Zero force laws play a very important role in scientific theories, because we can’t begin to understand what a force does until we understand what would happen in the absence of any forces. Consider Newton’s famous dictum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An object in motion tends to remain in motion in a straight line. An object at rest tends to remain at rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or (as you may remember from introductory physics)<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[F = ma \quad.\]</span> If we observe an object accelerating, we can immediately infer that a force is acting on it. Not only that, we can also infer something about the magnitude of the force. <span><strong>However</strong></span>, if an object is not accelerating we cannot conclude that no forces are acting. It might be that opposing forces act on the object in such a way that the resultant is no <span><em>net</em></span> force. Acceleration is a <span> <em>sufficient</em></span> condition to infer that force is operating on an object, but it is not <span><em>necessary</em></span>.</p>
<p>What we might call the “First Law of Population Genetics” is analogous to Newton’s First Law of Motion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all genotypes at a particular locus have the same average fecundity and the same average chance of being included in the breeding population, allele frequencies in the population will remain constant from one generation to the next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the rest of the semester we’ll be learning about the processes that cause allele frequencies to change and learning how to infer the properties of those processes from the changes that they induce. But you must always remember that while we can infer that some evolutionary process is happening if allele frequencies change from one generation to the next, we <span><em>cannot</em></span> infer the absence of an evolutionary process from a lack of allele frequency change.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>As you’ll see, we can’t actually say much about <span> <em>fathers</em></span>, but we can make inferences about the genes they contributed to the offspring.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>Assuming we’re looking at data from a locus that has only two alleles. If there were four alleles at a locus, for example, <span><em>all</em></span> of the offspring could be heterozygous. If you don’t see that immediately, think about an <span class="math inline">\(A_1A_2\)</span> mother mating with an <span class="math inline">\(A_3A_4\)</span> father and write out the Punnett square. We are also assuming that meiosis is fair, i.e., that there’s no segregation distortion, and that there’s no gamete competition and no gamete-gamete assortative mating. If you don’t know what any of that means don’t worry about it. We’ll get to (most of) it over the next few weeks.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>Those of you who don’t know me will soon come to expect that there is (almost always) more math coming. But don’t get scared. I don’t expect you to reproduce the match. I show it to you so that you understand where the tools we will use come from.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn7" role="doc-endnote"><p>Don’t worry if you’re not good at physics. I’m probably worse. What I’m telling you now is almost the only thing about physics I can remember. I graduated from college with only one semester of college physics, and it didn’t even require calculus as a pre-requisite. My brother is an electrical engineer, and he is appalled by my inability to remember Ohm’s Law.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8" role="doc-endnote"><p>If you’ve been paying very close attention, you will have noticed that I changed from talking about “forces” to talking about “evolutionary processes.” There’s a reason for that. One important evolutionary process, genetic drift, isn’t a force. Merriam-Webster defines force as “strength or energy exerted or brought to bear.” While natural selection can be thought of as a force, since it “pushes” a population in a particular direction, genetic drift can’t be thought of as a force, since it describes the random change of a population that happens because it is small and when the change doesn’t have a directional tendency.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
